# LEIP Tutorials and Examples

These tutorials provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles and practical steps required to master the LEIP frameworks.  These tutorials will assist both beginners and those looking to deepen their understanding.

## Getting Set Up

Learn the basics -- installing LEIP, setting up your system, interacting with LEIP using the Python API and the different LEIP clients.  

* [Setting up your environment](examples/environment.md) -- Learn how to set up a Python environment that can simultaneously access the Application and Compiler Frameworks. 

## Optimizing with LEIP

Once you have the basics down, continue by using the Application Frameworks' recipes and the Compiler Frameworks' optimization components. 

* [Getting started with recipes](/notebooks/GettingStarted.ipynb) -- Walk through the basics of optimizing and compiling your model for various targets. You'll use the Application Framework and Recipe Designer to explore, train, evaluate and export the model; you'll then use the Compiler Framework to further optimize and evaluate your model. 
* [Exploring the Golden Recipes](/notebooks/golden_recipe_tutorial.ipynb) -- Query, Explore and Selecting a Golden Recipe for you application and dataset.
* [Executing Tasks](/notebooks/executing_recipe.ipynb) --  Visualize your data, train a model, evaluate it, visualize its predictions, and export your model.

## Integrating with LEIP

Learn how to integrate the LEIP frameworks with other MLOps frameworks and service providers such as AWS and Azure. 

* [AWS Sagemaker Integration](examples/aws_sagemaker.md) -- Learn how to train and optimize a model using the LEIP framework and AWS Sagemaker.
